          <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
          <p class="lead mb-4">As a student at the University of California Riverside I have learned how important it is to learn how to work with people and ro understand what they want in their products and lives.Because of this my skills will help me succeed in the future
            politician and attorney. I made this site so others will be able to acheive the same success as me This website highligtes the experiences I have had at the County Counsel, restaurant, poliical campaigna nd officer positions I have held in
            my sorority. . <br><br> The internsip I have had at the County Counsel taught me how to file papers and organize case files and work with other lawyers. My experience at working in a restaurant taught me how to work in all types of speeds
            and how to work with all kinds of people. Both taught me how to work well with people and how it is important to find a good circle in coworkers to help you succeed and then you return that favor.At the restaurant I was a busser so it was
            not the most glamorous job but it taught me how to work harder than anyone else so my work would be apreciated and then I could earn myself the opportunity to become a waitress. For the political campaign I was a volunteer for, I was in charge
            of organizing kids that were around my age to help advertise for the candiates campaign. We did this by hanging up signs, calling people, hanging up fliers and posters. I also posted information about her on my social media so I could get
            the word out about her faster and for more people to see her and learn her name so they could do their own research about her. She did not end up winning the election cause she was a democrat running in a very conservative district. However,
            she was extremely close and held her own throughout the process.<br><br> For my sorority I was previously in charge of helping plan events, and my amin agenda was to plan the biggest dance for our chapter. In this position I learned how to
            market and advertise better. I had to interact with different organizations and with businesses that are not affiliated with the school such as venues,transportation and food, and music. FOr this upcoming year I will be in charge of planning
            more events and I hope to improve on those skills that I have already developed and lead more women into feeling confident about themselves and learn they can become a leader also.
